# SS-Builder
This repository is for the Soccer Squad builder Website that I am developing.
The main goal is to have a functional page that allows the admin to add/delete/update Leagues, Teams, and players into the database
This info will be used later on by the user who would be able to create their own squad with any player the database has,
They will also be capable to change formations, change the player number, add/remove goals/assists/Cards/injury status
